# HJ Hybrid Reachability

Code implementation of the work presented in [Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability Analysis for Hybrid Systems with Controlled and Forced Transitions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10893)

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Matlab
* HelperOC by the HJ Reachability Group (https://github.com/HJReachability/helperOC)
* Level Set Methods Toolbox by Ian Mitchell (https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~mitchell/ToolboxLS/).

### Installing

* Clone the repo and add contents to your Matlab path.

### Executing program

* To test proper functionality run \hj_hybrid_reachability\02_dog1D\brt_dog1D.m example file
* Expected result is the following value function:
